          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <h5>|| Learner ||</h5>
          <p>
            I am a passionate Computer Science Engineer (CSE) currently
            pursuing my degree at Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology, 
            Greater Noida. I have completed my first year and am on track to graduate
            in the year 2026.
          </p> 
          <h5>Strengths and Weaknesses:</h5>
          <p> 
            My strength is I'm self-motivated,
            hardworking and dedicated person and I can do whatever you assigned me
            according to my skills and my weakness is I feel uncomfortable until and
            unless I finish my task and I feel very awkward while asking for someone's help. <br />
            In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, immersing myself in
            artistic world, and experiencing interactive storytelling.
            My dedication to becoming an exceptional developer and my
            enthusiasm for lifelong learning will undoubtedly propel me
            towards a successful career in the field of Computer Science
            Engineering. I will continue to pursue my passions and interests,
            and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
