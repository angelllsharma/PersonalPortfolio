                    <h5>Python Projects</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        As my programming journey began, I designed various python projects out of interests that
                        included Registration Form, Calculator, Webpage, Tic-Tac Games and Snake Games. Python is a
                        versatile and easy-to-use language. Python’s various web frameworks are especially useful — like
                        the popular Django, which can make building both back end and client-side functionality easier
                        and faster. I am excited to continue exploring and creating many more Python-programming
                        projects in the future.

                    <h5>Contact Form</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        The "Contact Form" is a user-friendly project developed using HTML and CSS. It allows users to
                        submit their information and send messages directly from your website. A form is an essential
                        component of a website that helps in logging in, signing up, sending orders, pieces of
                        information, queries, uploading files, and carrying out online transactions. In other words,
                        forms are the stepping stone to making a website interactive.

                    <h5>Personal Portfolio</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        "Personal Portfolio" is a website project, developed using HTML and CSS, where you are currently
                        viewing this project. The website serves as a showcase of your professional information,
                        including skills, strengths and weaknesses, and achievements. With its clean and visually
                        appealing design, it offers visitors a comprehensive overview of your background, projects, and
                        contact information. This portfolio project not only demonstrates your proficiency in HTML and
                        CSS but also provides a platform for others to explore and learn more about your abilities and
                        accomplishments.

                    <h5>Design Mind</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Through my expedition, I recognized that learning to code was not just about acquiring technical
                        skills but also cultivating a critical thinking mindset, separating intricate problems into
                        smaller components, and generating innovative solutions. In order to get ahold of it, a basic
                        project was created by me using the design thinking. The project simulates reasons on plastic
                        ban, why it is necessary and how it is harmful to human beings? and gives solutions using design
                        mindset through process like brainstorming and prototyping to put an end to such wicked problem.

                    <p>
                    <p>“Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes.” which basically tells us to embrace
                        failure. When you make a mistake, take a moment to recognize what it is you did wrong,
                        how to fix it, and how to avoid repeating your mistake in the future. Programming is the same
                        thing while you program you might continously face an error but what important is to keep trying
                        and stand back stronger.</p>
